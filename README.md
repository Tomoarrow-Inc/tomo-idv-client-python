# Tomo IDV Client Python

Python client SDK for the Tomo Identity Verification API.

Generated API bindings are written from `sdk.openapi.json` into
`tomo_idv_client.generated`. Manual code in `tomo_idv_client` provides OAuth2
client assertion helpers shared with the Node and Kotlin SDKs.

## Development

Run verification from the superproject with Docker. Do not install Python
dependencies on the host machine.

```bash
source ./dcp
dcp local sdk python
```

Regenerate the OpenAPI client from the superproject with Docker:

```bash
source ./dcp
dcp contract gen
```
